abstract = "Dynamic spectrum access is a promising technique designed to meet the challenge of rapidly growing demands for broadband access in cognitive radio networks. By utilizing the allocated spectrum, cognitive radio devices can provide high throughput and low latency communications. This paper introduces an efficient dynamic spectrum allocation algorithm in cognitive radio networks based on the network utility maximization framework. The objective function in this optimization problem is always nonconvex, which makes the problem difficult to solve. Prior works on network resource optimization always transformed the nonconvex optimization problem into a convex one under some strict assumptions, which do not meet the actual networks. We solve the nonconvex optimization problem directly using an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Simulated annealing (SA), combined with \{PSO\} to form the \{PSOSA\} algorithm, overcomes the inherent defects and disadvantages of these two individual components. Simulations show that the proposed solution achieves significant throughput compared with existing approaches, and it is efficient in solving the nonconvex optimization problem. "

abstract="Combating the growing necessity of radio spectrum, which is a limited natural resource, proper utilization of the radio spectrum is a must. Cognitive radio network (CRN) plays a vibrant role to solve this spectrum scarcity problem. Cognitive radio uses an open spectrum allocation technique to make more efficient utilization of the wireless radio spectrum and reduces the bottleneck on the frequency bands. Thus, accessible spectrum information is required for communication in CRN, which can be acquired by using spectrum database or by spectrum sensing. In addition, a robust architecture with appropriate communication protocol is preconditioned in the deployment of CRN. The state of the art of cognitive radio ad-hoc network architecture is surveyed in this paper, where the paper specifies the formation mechanisms and performance evaluations of the studied architectures. The reviewed papers have addressed some vital issues for the concrete deployment of cognitive radio ad-hoc network; however, there remain some issues that need to be addressed. Thus, this paper conveys a thorough and abstract understanding of cognitive radio ad-hoc network architecture, and also points out some open research issues in this area.",

neutral: only consider how to determine the set of available channels, deciding which channels among the available channels to used is not discussed.

1. demonstrate the feasibility of using suitable propagation models (Longley-Rice and terrain) to predict spectrum. All WSDs including BSs and clients rely solely on that.
2. terrain server cache and precomputation is used to ficilate system scalability.
0. consider availble channels for clients, as the the mobility issue of clients, protection regio which is bigger than actual distance between client and incumbent. clients must know their location in order to use the white space efficiently. using small granularity requires large amount infomation of channel availability for all grids, 'set-cover approximation algortihm' is used to decrease this.
0. The changes of TV transmitter is avergely once in 2 days.

what: Talk about how to distributedly decide SB's transmission power to avoid violating the interference threshold when multiple SBs are transmitting; 
This paper proposes a distribted learning scheme for each WRAN (a distributed algorithm), the evaluation function is somehow like a penalty function: c=(sinr_t1t - sinr_{th});;
con: WRAN 802.22 standard, each base station has its own 'control point', the SINR on the control point is used as the that of primary system;
power levels inmolved;
static, no margin for new SBs, when there is new SBs comes or a change of the WRAN network happens, power adjustment is needed;
1000 steps before convergence from simulation, no theorical complexity analysis;
Qos provided undedr the transmission power.
pro: Q-learning algorithm is said to have an optimal policy based on Bellman#s optimality. Q-learning records the cost over time.

abstract={We present decentralized adaptive filtering algorithms for sensor activation control in an unattended ground sensor network (UGSN) comprised of ZigBee-enabled nodes. Nodes monitor their environment in a low-power ldquosleeprdquo mode, until an intruder is detected, then must decide whether to enter a full-power monitoring and transmission mode if their estimated average performance for activation outweighs their energy cost. The tradeoff is formulated in terms of the energy required to transmit data using the ZigBee protocol, probability of successful transmission, and the expected marginal increase in global utility resulting from a report, all of which depend on the activity of nearby sensor nodes. Since activation control is decentralized, and utilities are codependent, the adaptive filtering/stochastic approximation algorithms that we propose for sensor activation are based on game theoretic principles. We show that if each sensor operates according to this algorithm, the entire network is capable of actively tracking the correlated equilibrium set of the underlying game, which varies with target motion, node failures, or intentional parameter adjustments. We analyze the convergence and tracking properties of the adaptive filtering algorithms using differential inclusions.},

abstract={This paper considers downlink spectrum allocation in a long term evolution (LTE) system macrocell which contains multiple femtocells. By incorporating cognitive capabilities into femtocell base stations, the Home evolved Node Bs (HeNBs) can be formulated as secondary base stations seeking to maximize the spectrum utility while minimizing interference to primary base stations (evolved Node-Bs). The competition amongst cognitive HeNBs for spectrum resources is formulated as a non-cooperative game-theoretic learning problem where each agent (HeNB) seeks to adapt its strategy in real time. We formulate the resource block (RB) allocation among HeNBs in the downlink of a LTE system using a game-theoretic framework, where the correlated equilibrium solutions of the formulated game are being investigated. A distributed RB access algorithm is proposed to compute the correlated equilibrium RB allocation policy..},

abstract={Existing capacity constrained cellular networks that operate in fixed spectrum bands can be enhanced with capacity-on-demand services using the Coordinated Dynamic Spectrum Access (CDSA) model. In this model, a centralized spectrum broker coordinates access to spectrum in a given region and assigns short term spectrum leases to competing wireless service providers and/or end users. In contrast to existing multi-year cellular spectrum licenses that span large regions, a spectrum broker can grant spectrum leases that are for small regions (e.g.: per base station) and valid for short durations (e.g.: tens of minutes). Fast spectrum allocation algorithms are crucial to the design of scalable spectrum brokers that can provide such realtime spectrum access. In this paper, we address this challenge. Specifically, we formulate the spectrum allocation problem as two optimization problems: first with the objective of maximizing the overall demand (Max-Demand) satisfied among the various base stations and the second with the objective of minimizing the overall interference in the network (Min-Interference) when all the demands of the base stations are satisfied. We show that the optimization problems are NP-hard and design efficient algorithms to solve them. Our simulation results on sample network topologies show that our algorithms scale very well for large network sizes.},

abstract={Channel assignment has been extensively researched for multi-radio wireless mesh networks, but it is still very challenging when it comes to its implementation. In this paper we propose a semi-dynamic and distributed channel assignment mechanism called SICA that uses game theory. To the best of our knowledge this is the first game formulation of channel assignment which takes the co-channel interference into account. SICA is an interference aware, distributed channel assignment which preserves the network connectivity without relying on a common channel nor central node for coordination between mesh routers. SICA applies an on-line learner algorithm which assumes that nodes do not have perfect information. We have simulated SICA and compared against another interference-aware channel assignment mechanism proposed in the literature called Urban-X. Simulation results show that SICA outperforms Urban-X, even using fewer radio interfaces per node.},

In the first phase, a distributed power updating process is employed at the cognitive and primary nodes to maximize the coverage of the cognitive network while always maintaining the constrained signal to interference plus noise ratio of primary transmissions.

abstract={In this work, we study the problem of how to strike a balance between the QoS provisioning and the energy efficiency when a cooperative communication scheme is applied to a clustered wireless sensor network. Specifically, we first characterize the tradeoff by a multi-variable optimization problem, with the goal of balancing the outage performance and the network lifetime. Then, we horizontally decompose the problem into the concatenation of two subproblems: i) the long-haul transmit power per sensor node, and ii) the set of assisting cluster nodes. For the former one, an optimal long-haul transmit power solution is proposed based on the Lambert W function. The latter one is modeled as a coalition formation game, where the characteristic function is designed based on the combination of the former subproblem's results. Furthermore, an optimal algorithm is proposed by using a dynamic coalition formation process based on the best-reply process with trial opportunity. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

We assume that data compression and cooperative communications can be carried out within one coalition, and that CSMA is used to reserve the channel from the coalitions to the sink. We examine three schemes for data transmissions from the coalition (with reservation) to the sink. In Scheme 1, one node in the coalition is selected randomly to transmit the data; in Scheme 2, the node with the best channel condition in the coalition transmits the data; and in Scheme 3, all the nodes in the coalition transmit in a cooperative manner. We investigate the corresponding delay performance and the energy consumption of the three schemes. Our numerical examples show that significant gains can be achieved by the coalition-aided transmission schemes, and as expected, Scheme 3 achieves the best performance.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of the formation of an uplink tree structure among the IEEE 802.16J network's relay stations (RSs) and their serving base station (MR-BS). We model the problem as a network formation game in which the RSs want to form a directed tree graph to improve their utility, in terms of the packet success rate (PSR), by using multi-hop cooperative transmission while accounting for a link maintenance cost. In this game, the relay stations engage in bilateral negotiations which result in a contractual agreement to form a directed link between each pair. For network dynamics, we propose an algorithm based on the local best responses of the RSs that converges to a local Nash network. Moreover, the proposed dynamics algorithm allows the RSs to autonomously adapt the network topology to changes in the environment due to mobility or to the presence of heterogeneous traffic. Simulation results show how the RSs can self-organize in a tree structure while improving the network's overall PSR up to 19.7% and 17.3% compared, respectively, to the cases where no RSs exist and where the RSs are directly connected to the MR-BS.}, 
notes={

utilize myopic strategy to form a tree structure which is also a local nash, the algorithm is from \cite{wine08}, the downside is there is only one path for each relay.
Evebtually, there is only one path (the one with the best BER metric, but is this path unaffected by the dynamics caused by other relay nodes?) for each relay node, 
convergence to local nash equilibrium is not proved!

abstract={Enabling users to connect to the best available network, dynamic network selection scheme is important for satisfying various quality of service #40;QoS #41; requirements, achieving seamless mobility and load balancing in heterogeneous wireless networks. In this paper, we formulate the network selection problem in heterogeneous wireless networks with incomplete information as a Bayesian game. In general, the preference #40;i.e., utility #41; of a mobile user is private information. Therefore, each user has to make the decision of network selection optimally given only the partial information of the preferences of other users. To study the dynamics of such network selection, the Bayesian best response dynamics and aggregate best response dynamics are applied. Bayesian Nash equilibrium is considered to be the solution of this game, and there is a one-to-one mapping between the Bayesian Nash equilibrium and the equilibrium distribution of the aggregate dynamics. The numerical results show the convergence of the aggregate best response dynamics for this Bayesian network selection game. This result ensures that even with incomplete information, the equilibrium of network selection decisions of mobile users can be reached.},

abstract={This paper addresses the power control problem in wireless networks where transmitters choose their control policy freely and selfishly in order to maximize their individual energy-efficiency. In this framework, two new scenarios are studied in details: 1. a scenario where a fraction of the transmitters can observe the power levels of the other transmitters while the latter have no sensing capabilities; 2. a scenario where the observation structure is triangular, that is, the kth transmitter can observe the k - 1th transmitters (which corresponds to a multi-level hierarchical game). In both scenarios the equilibrium analysis (existence, uniqueness, determination, efficiency) is conducted. In scenario 1, it is proved that the game outcome Pareto dominates the one obtained when no transmitters can sense the others. Taking the sensing cost into account, a simple condition under which being a follower (namely a transmitter who senses) is better than a leader is provided. Interestingly, the existence of an optimum fraction of cognitive transmitters in terms of sum utility is proved in the case where the sensing cost is neglected. In scenario 2, it is proved analytically that knowing more leads to a better utility and the game outcome Pareto dominates the solution with no sensing. The derived results are illustrated by numerical results and provide some insights on how to deploy cognitive radios in heterogeneous networks in terms of sensing capabilities.},

Four channel models are considered and developed: the decoded relaying multihop channel; the amplified relaying multihop channel; the decoded relaying multihop diversity channel; and the amplified relaying multihop diversity channel. Two classifications are discussed: decoded relaying versus amplified relaying, and multihop channels versus multihop diversity channels. The channel models are compared, through analysis and simulations, with the "singlehop" (direct transmission) reference channel on the basis of signal-to-noise ratio, probability of outage, probability of error, and optimal power allocation. Each of the four channel models is shown to outperform the singlehop reference channel under the condition that the set of intermediate relaying terminals is selected intelligently. Multihop diversity channels are shown to outperform multihop channels. Amplified relaying is shown to outperform decoded relaying despite noise propagation. This is attributed to the fact that amplified relaying does not suffer from the error propagation which limits the performance of decoded relaying channels to that of their weakest link.},

Observing that the globally optimal point lies on the boundary of the feasible region, we transform the utility maximization problem into a more structured problem in the form of maximizing the minimum weighted utility. Then, we develop a centralized algorithm for the minimum weighted utility maximization problem as a benchmark. Next, by using extended duality theory, we introduce penalty multipliers and decompose the minimum weighted utility maximization problem into subproblems for individual users. Appealing to the simulated annealing method, we propose a distributed stochastic power control algorithm, where each user stochastically adjusts its target utility to improve the overall system utility. Although the underlying optimization problem is nonconvex, our algorithm can guarantee global optimality although the convergence rate may be slow due to the usage of simulated annealing. We improve the convergence rate further by devising an enhanced algorithm based on the geometric cooling schedule.},

We present two distributed iterative algorithms which require limited information exchange and data processing at each base station. Both algorithms provably converge to a solution where no base station can unilaterally modify its status (i.e., transmit power and user selection) to improve the weighted sum-rate of the network.

Under a SINR-driven model, we consider channel assignments in a network using dynamic source routing (DSR). In this unicasting model, channel assignments are conducted in a relatively small scale of nodes, which are on the chosen route. In addition, we can make use of the route reply (RREP) message in DSR to estimate the SINR and the maximum data transmission rate of nodes on the chosen route. In this way, the source node can conduct the channel assignment in a more efficient way. We propose two algorithms for the single route and multi-route channel assignments, where the multi-route scheme uses alternative nodes to help transmitting. We give a complexity analysis of two algorithms and an extension of reducing complexity for the multi-route channel assignment algorithm. Finally, we conduct simulations of our two algorithms under networks with different densities and show that the performance of our algorithms is efficient.},

Specifically, there is no published investigation of the relation between routing overhead on one hand and route request pattern (traffic) on the other. This paper provides a mathematical framework for quantifying the overhead of a cluster-based routing protocol. We explicitly model the application-level traffic in terms of the statistical description of the number of hops between a source and a destination. The network topology is modelled by a regular two-dimensional grid of unreliable nodes, and expressions for various components of the routing overhead are derived. The results show that clustering does not change the traffic requirement for infinite scalability compared to flat protocols, but reduces the overhead by a factor of O(1/M) where M is the cluster size. The analytic results are validated against simulations of random network topologies running a well known (D-hop max-min) clustering algorithm.},

abstract={When monitoring environments with wireless sensor networks, optimal sensor deployment is a fundamental issue and an effective means to achieve desired performance. Selecting best sensor deployment has a dependence on the deployment environments. Existing works address sensor deployment within three types of environments including one dimensional line, 2-D field and 3-D space. However, in many applications the deployment environments usually have network structures, which cannot be simply classified as the three types. The deployed locations and communications of sensor nodes are limited onto the network edges, which make the deployment problem distinct from that in other types of environments. In this paper, we study sensor deployment in network-structured environments and aim to achieve k-coverage while minimizing the number of sensor nodes. Furthermore, we jointly consider the optimization of sink deployment and routing strategies with the goal to minimize the network communication cost of data collection. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to tackle sensor/sink deployment under the deployment constraints imposed by the network structure. The hardness of the problems is shown. Polynomial-time algorithms are proposed to determine optimal sensor/sink deployment and routing strategies in tree-topology network structure. Efficient approximation algorithms are proposed for the general graph network structure and their performances are analyzed. Theoretical results and extensive simulations show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.},

In this paper, we explore the use of directionality in layer 3 to facilitate routing in highly mobile environments. We introduce mobile orthogonal rendezvous routing protocol (MORRP), a lightweight, but scalable routing protocol utilizing directional communications (such as directional antennas or free-space-optical transceivers) to relax information requirements such as coordinate space embedding, node localization, and mobility. This relaxation is done by introducing a novel concept called the directional routing table (DRT) which maps a set-of-IDs to each directional interface to provide probabilistic routing information based on interface direction. We show that MORRP achieves connectivity with high probability even in highly mobile environments while maintaining only probabilistic information about destinations. We also compare MORRP with various proactive, reactive, and position-based routing protocols using single omni-directional interfaces and 8 directional interfaces and show that MORRP gains over 10-14X additional goodput vs. traditional protocols and 15-20% additional goodput vs. traditional protocols using multiple interfaces.},

abstract={Recent advances in cognitive radio (CR) technology have brought about a number of wireless standards that support opportunistic access to available white-space spectrum. Addressing the self-coexistence of CR networks in such an environment is very challenging, especially when coexisting networks operate in the same swath of spectrum with little or no direct coordination. In this paper, we study the problem of co-channel self-coexistence of uncoordinated CR networks that employ orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in the uplink. We frame the self-coexistence problem as a non-cooperative game, and propose an uplink soft frequency reuse (USFR) technique to enable globally power-efficient and locally fair sharing of white-space spectrum. In each network, uplink resource allocation is decoupled into two subproblems: subchannel allocation (SCA) and transmit power control (TPC). We provide a unique optimal solution to the TPC subproblem, and present a low-complexity heuristic for the SCA subproblem. Furthermore, we frame the TPC and SCA games, and integrate them as a heuristic algorithm that achieves the Nash equilibrium in a fully distributed manner. Our simulation results show that the proposed USFR technique significantly improves self-coexistence in several aspects, including spectrum utilization, power consumption, and intra-cell fairness.},

abstract={The Cognitive Radio (CR) technology enables the unlicensed users to share the spectrum with the licensed users on a non-interfering basis. Spectrum sensing is an important function for the unlicensed users to determine availability of a channel in the licensed user's spectrum. However, spectrum sensing consumes considerable energy which can be reduced by employing predictive methods for discovering spectrum holes. Using a reliable prediction scheme, the unlicensed users will sense only those channels which are predicted to be idle. By achieving a low probability of error in predicting the idle channels, the spectrum utilization can also be improved. Since the traffic characteristics of most licensed user systems encountered in real life are not known a priori, we design the spectrum predictor using the neural network model, multilayer perceptron (MLP), which does not require a prior knowledge of the traffic characteristics of the licensed user systems. The performance of the spectrum predictor is analyzed through extensive simulations.},

abstract={This paper studies the repeated power control game in cognitive radio (CR) networks through reinforcement learning without channel and power strategy information exchange among CR users. Unlike traditional game-theoretical approaches on CR power control, this research solves the incomplete information power control problems for selfish and autonomous CR users for the first time. Each CR user in the problem only knows its own channel and power strategy while the information of primary users (PUs) and other different types of CR users are unknown. The formulated power control problem is a constrained repeated stochastic game with learning automaton. The objective of this repeated game is to maximize the average utility of each CR user under the interference power constraints of PUs. At each time step, the CR user only knows its own utility and the interference functions after the play but no further information. This power control game is proved to be asymptotically equivalent to the traditional game theory approaches. The properties of existence, diagonal concavity and uniqueness for this game are illustrated in detail. A Bush-Mosteller reinforcement learning procedure is designed for the power control algorithm. Finally, the learning based power control algorithm is implemented, and the simulation results with detailed analysis are shown to enforce the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

The Markov game theoretical modeling approach is investigated to deal with the power control in the cognitive radio (CR) context, which well captures the learning and adaptation abilities of CRs. With the complex interaction relationship of multiple secondary users (SUs), multiple primary users (PUs) with wireless coexistent environment into consideration, both the secondary overall utility maximization and fairness among the SUs are considered from the mathematical model formulation and the algorithm design perspective. A power control approach to searching for the fair and optimal Nash equilibrium solution (NES) based on the improved multi-agent Q-learning is proposed. Meanwhile, the parameters of the presented algorithm are analyzed through simulations.

abstract={In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), effective and efficient channel exploitation is imperative for unlicensed secondary users to seize available network resources and improve resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a simple channel sensing order for secondary users in multi-channel CRNs without a priori knowledge of primary user activities. By sensing the channels according to the descending order of their achievable rates with optimal stopping, we show that the proposed channel exploitation approach is efficient yet effective in elevating throughput and resource utilization. Simulation results show that our proposed channel exploitation approach outperforms its counterparts by up to 18% in a single-secondary user pair scenario. In addition, we investigate the probability of packet transmission collision in a multi-secondary user pair scenario, and show that the probability of collision decreases as the number of channels increases and/or the number of secondary user pairs decreases. It is observed that the total throughput and resource utilization increase with the number of secondary user pairs due to increased transmission opportunities and multi-user diversity. Our results also demonstrate that resource utilization can be further improved via the proposed channel exploitation approach when the number of secondary user pairs approaches the number of channels.},

In this paper, we investigate the path selection problem in multi-hop cognitive radio networks (CRNs) under constraints on flow routing, link scheduling and CR source's budget. We extend the per-user based spectrum trading in prior work to CR session-based spectrum trading, and effectively develop the spectrum trading mechanisms based on the cross-layer optimization in multi-hop CRNs. We introduce a new service provider, called emph{secondary service provider} (SSP), to help CR sessions to select the paths for packet delivery. Considering the price of bands and the potential returning of primary services at different CR links, the SSP purchases the licensed spectrum and jointly conducts flow routing and link scheduling under the budget constraints. We also propose a 4-dimensional conflict graph to characterize the conflict relationship among CR links and mathematically formulate the path selection problem under multiple constraints into an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the end-to-end throughput. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we have also developed a heuristic algorithm to find the approximate solution.},

abstract={Two main issues affect the existing routing metrics for cognitive radio ad hoc networks: i) they are often based on heuristics, and thus they have not been proved to be optimal; ii) they do not account for the route diversity effects, and thus they are not able to measure the actual cost of a route. In this paper, an optimal routing metric for cognitive radio ad hoc networks, referred to as OPERA, is proposed. OPERA is designed to achieve two features: i) Optimality: OPERA is optimal when combined with both Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford based routing protocols; ii) Accuracy: OPERA exploits the route diversity provided by the intermediate nodes to measure the actual end-to-end delay, by taking explicitly into account the unique characteristics of cognitive radio networks. A closed-form expression of the proposed routing metric is analytically derived for both static and mobile networks, and its optimality is proved rigorously. Performance evaluation is conducted through simulations, and the results reveal the benefits of adopting the proposed routing metric for cognitive radio ad hoc networks.},

abstract={Routing in multi-hop cognitive radio networks (CRN) should be spectrum-aware. In this paper, two adaptive reinforcement learning based spectrum-aware routing protocols are introduced. Q-learning and dual reinforcement learning are applied respectively for them. The cognitive nodes store a table of Q values that estimate the numbers of available channels on the routes and update them while routing. So they can adaptively learn good routes which have more available channels from just local information. Compared to the previous spectrum aware routing protocols in multi-hop cognitive radio networks, they are simpler and easier to implement, more cost-effective, and can avoid drawbacks in on-demand protocols but still keep adaptive and dynamic routing. Both of our protocols perform better than the spectrum-aware shortest path protocol when network load is not too low. In the meantime, spectrum-aware DRQ-routing learns the optimal routing policy 1.5 times as fast as the spectrum-aware Q-routing at low and medium network load. It also learns a routing policy which is more than seven times as good as that of spectrum-aware Q-routing at high network load.},

A wide variety of secondary system operating scenarios must be considered in any potential interference analysis, as described below. Several different types of licensed television transmitters currently exist in the TV bands, along with secondary licensed services, such as wireless microphones. All licensed services must be adequately protected from harmful interference, which can readily and reliably be achieved with the described geo-location database methods. Specific implementation details of geo-location databases are discussed, including several complexity reduction techniques. Geo-location database techniques are also shown to more efficiently utilize available spectrum than other spectrum access techniques.},

However, how to design a multi-cell infrastructure-based secondary network to dynamically access TV white spaces with the help of database is still an open issue. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of WhiteNet, a multi-cell infrastructure-based dynamic spectrum access system on TV white spaces. WhiteNet is compatible with the FCC's database architecture. In WhiteNet, the geo-location database is exploited to assist multi-AP coordination. A low-overhead distributed spectrum allocation algorithm is proposed to allocate spectrum among multiple APs in WhiteNet, considering the heterogeneous propagation property among various spectrum bands throughout TV white spaces. A novel AP discovery scheme is designed to enable users to discover and select the best access point to connect. We implement WhiteNet in a 7-node GNU Radio testbed, which demonstrates the feasibility of our system. Evaluation results show that our spectrum allocation algorithm can significantly increase total network throughput, besides, the AP discovery scheme is reliable and efficient.},

A model for sensing under hypothesis is given and for a sensing threshold the respective probability of detection and false alarm are derived. Then a throughput model is formed that depends on these two quantities. For a given detection probability, the objective is then to maximize the throughput subject to the variable length of the sensing period. A longer sensing period yields a lower probability of false alarm but less time remaining for the data transmission and vice versa. The paper proves for energy detection the existence of an optimal sensing period but does not state a formula for it. Numerically, the authors show for the case of 802.22 and the FCC sensing requirements (P_d = 0.9 at SNR = - 15 dB) that the longer the sensing takes, the lower is the probability of false alarm. Furthermore, there is indeed the an optimal sensign period while the optimal sensing period is also dependent on the number of terminals in the cell (the larger the terminals, the lower is the sensing period), which leads to a higher capacity.},

Given that the nodes observe a TDMA/ALOHA MAC protocol, our objective is to determine the number of relays and their placement such that the mean end-to-end delay in a typical route of the network is minimized. We first study an idealistic network model where all routes have the same number of hops, the same distance per hop and their own dedicated relays. Combining tools from queueing theory and stochastic geometry, we provide a precise characterization of the mean end-to-end delay. We find that the delay is minimized if the first hop is much longer than the remaining hops and that the optimal number of hops scales sublinearly with the source-destination distance. Simulating the original network scenario reveals that the analytical results are accurate, provided that the density of the relay process is sufficiently large. We conclude that, given the considered MAC protocol, our analysis provides a delay-minimizing routing strategy for random, multihop networks involving a small number of hops.},

abstract={The November 2008 FCC ruling allowing access to the television white-spaces prompts a natural question. What is the magnitude and geographic distribution of the opportunity that has been opened up? This paper takes a semi-empirical perspective and uses the FCC's database of television transmitters, USA census data from 2000, and standard wireless propagation and information-theoretic capacity models to see the distribution of data-rates available on a per-person basis for wireless Internet access across the continental USA. To get a realistic evaluation of the potential public benefit, we need to examine more than just how many white-space channels have been made available. It is also important to consider the impact of wireless "pollution" from existing television stations, the self-interference among white-space devices themselves, the population distribution, and the expected transmission range of the white-space devices. The clear advantage of the white-space approach is revealed through a direct comparison of the Pareto frontier of the new white-space approach and that corresponding to the traditional approach of refarming bands between television and wireless data service. Finally, the critical importance of economic investment considerations is shown by considering the status of rural versus urban areas. Based on technical considerations alone, whether we consider long- or short-range white-space systems, people in rural areas would seem to be the main beneficiaries of white-space systems. A power-law distribution even appears that suggests that many rural customers could enjoy tremendous data-rates. However, the fundamental need to recover investments by wireless ISPs couples the range inversely to the population density. This clips the tail of the power-law and shows that urban and suburban areas can actually get significant benefit from the TV white-spaces. Overall, the opportunity provided by TV white-spaces is shown to be potentially of the same order a- - s the recent release of "beachfront" 700MHz spectrum for wireless data service.},

In this paper, we present a novel game theoretic framework that uses the potentialities of the new IEEE 802.22 Standard to guarantee self-coexistence among Wireless Regional Area Networks. We address this problem as a channel assignment problem where each WRAN acquires a chunk of spectrum free of interference in a dynamic and distributed way. Using a novel technique to compute backoff windows, we show that the channel assignment problem can be formulated as a multi-player non-cooperative repeated potential game that converges to a Nash Equilibrium point.

abstract={The cognitive radio based IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area network (WRAN) is designed to operate in the under-utilized TV bands by detecting and avoiding primary TV transmission bands in a timely manner. Such networks, deployed by competing wireless service providers, would have to self-coexist by accessing different parts of the available spectrum in a distributed manner. Obviously, the goal of every network is to acquire a clear spectrum chunk free of interference from other IEEE 802.22 networks so as to satisfy the QoS of the services delivered to the end-users. In this paper, we study the distributed WRAN self-coexistence problem from a minority game theoretic perspective. We model the spectrum band switching game where the networks try to minimize their cost in finding a clear band. We propose a mixed strategy that the competing networks must adhere to in order to achieve the Nash equilibrium. Simulation experiments have also been conducted and results corroborate with the theoretical analysis.},

abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) improves spectrum efficiency by allowing secondary users (SUs) to dynamically exploit the idle spectrum owned by primary users (PUs). This paper studies optimal bandwidth allocation of SUs for throughput efficiency. Consider the following tradeoff: an SU increases its instantaneous throughput by accessing more spectrum, but channel access/switching overhead, contention among multiple SUs, and dynamic PU activity create higher liability for larger bandwidths. So how much is too much? In this paper, we study the optimal bandwidth allocation for multiple SUs. Our approach is twofold. We first study the optimal bandwidth an SU should use to maximize the per-SU throughput in the long term. The optimal bandwidth is derived in the context of dynamic PU activity, where we consider both independent and correlated PU channel scenarios while accounting for the effects of channel switching overhead. We further consider the case of suboptimal spectrum use by SUs in the short term due to PU activity dynamics. We propose an efficient channel reconfiguration (CREC) scheme to improve SUs' performance. We use real PU channel activity traces in the simulations to validate our results. The work sheds light on the design of spectrum sharing protocols in cognitive radio networks.},

year={2012},

abstract={Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are self-configuring wireless networks that lack permanent infrastructure and are formed among mobile nodes on demand. Rapid node mobility results in dramatic channel variation, or fading, that degrades MANET performance. Employing channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter can improve the throughput of routing and medium access control (MAC) protocols for mobile ad hoc networks. Several routing algorithms in the literature explicitly incorporate the fading signal strength into the routing metric, thus selecting the routes with strong channel conditions. While these studies show that adaptation to the time-variant channel gain is beneficial in MANETs, they do not address the effect of the outdated fading CSI at the transmitter. For realistic mobile node speeds, the channel gain is rapidly varying, and becomes quickly outdated due the feedback delay. We analyze the link throughput of joint rate adaptation and adaptive relay selection in the presence of imperfect CSI. Moreover, for an 802.11 network that employs geographic opportunistic routing with adaptive rate and relay selection, we propose a novel method to reduce the effect of the feedback delay at the MAC layer in the presence of Rayleigh fading. This method exploits channel reciprocity and fading prediction and does not require significant modification to the existing 802.11 frame structure. Extensive network simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the throughput, delay, and packet delivery ratio for high mobile velocities relative to previously proposed approaches that employ outdated CSI at the transmitter.},

abstract={Channel-adaptive relaying hhttp://www.icir.org/bkarp/gpsr/as recently been proposed as a means to exploit spatial and temporal diversity in multihop ad hoc networks with fading. In conjunction with appropriate routing protocols, adaptive relaying enables each forwarding node in a multihop path to dynamically select the next-hop relay as a function of the measured (time-varying) channel state, providing a form of selection diversity at each hop. Based on the notion that links to diversity-selected relays have higher information capacity and therefore can support higher data rates than links obtained with traditional routing, this paper proposes marrying channel-adaptive relaying with rate adaptation (or adaptive modulation-coding). In particular, we specify a protocol for performing joint rate and relay adaptation in 802.11 ad hoc networks with geographic routing. Using both analytical and simulation tools, synergistic gains are observed in throughput, capacity and delay. Performance results are given for individual links as well as for multihop networks, in time-varying, correlated Rayleigh and Ricean fading channels over a range of channel speeds. Of particular interest in this study is the robustness of the adaptation to increasing channel Doppler. As a by-product of this work, we propose a new, SNR-based rate adaptation scheme for use in 802.11 systems that requires no modification to the standard 802.11 frame structure},

abstract={Vehicular ad hoc networks using WLAN technology have recently received considerable attention. We present a position-based routing scheme called Connectivity-Aware Routing (CAR) designed specifically for inter-vehicle communication in a city and/or highway environment. A distinguishing property of CAR is the ability to not only locate positions of destinations but also to find connected paths between source and destination pairs. These paths are auto-adjusted on the fly, without a new discovery process. "Guards" help to track the current position of a destination, even if it traveled a substantial distance from its initially known location. For the evaluation of the CAR protocol we use realistic mobility traces obtained from a microscopic vehicular traffic simulator that is based on a model of driver behavior and the real road maps of Switzerland.},

abstract={Developing routing protocol for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) is a challenging task due to potentially large network sizes, rapidly changing topology and frequent network disconnections, which can cause failure or inefficiency in traditional ad hoc routing protocols. We propose an adaptive connectivity aware routing (ACAR) protocol that addresses these problems by adaptively selecting an optimal route with the best network transmission quality based on the statistical and realtime density data that are gathered through an on-the-fly density collection process. The protocol consists of two parts: (1) select an optimal route, consisting of road segments, with the best estimated transmission quality (2) in each road segment in the selected route, select the most efficient multi-hop path that will improve delivery ratio and throughput. The optimal route can be selected using our new connectivity model that takes into account vehicles densities and traffic light periods to estimate transmission quality at road segments, which considers the probability of connectivity and data delivery ratio for transmitting packets. In each road segment along the optimal path, each hop is selected to minimize the packet error rate of the entire path. Our simulation results show that the proposed ACAR protocol outperforms existing VANET routing protocols in terms of data delivery ratio, throughput and data packet delay. In addition, ACAR works very well even if accurate statistical data is not available.},

  notes= {
  1. discuss nodes' forwarding strategies, which are on one same routing path.
  2. Each node maintains credits table for 'neighbors'
  3. Node's unitity function is composed with throughtput utility and credit utility, both of which are function of credits and willingness.
  4. formulate the transmission into a sequential-move game, where each sender-relay pair conducts a stackelberg game. Solving the game (maxmizing utility, with constraints of power consumption) brings willingness and accordingly the possiblity of forwarding.
  
  merits:
  1. doesn't isolate selfish nodes
  2. proposes one strategy for all users, but doesn't promise any rewards for them, this maybe a reason for the low forwarding probability (70%).
  
  downsides:  
  1. this paper only talks about the transmission along one 'best' path which has been found beforehand (one advantage claimed by anthored to \cite{competitionRelay08infocom}), in case the relay refuses to forward, the packet is simpily dropped.
  2. As the there is only forwarding probability, so the throughput is not one goal.

abstract={We study pricing games in multi-hop relay networks where nodes price their services and route their traffic selfishly and strategically. Each node (1) makes a bid to each of its customers, specifying a charging function and a proposed traffic share, and (2) allocates its received traffic to its service providers. A node aims to maximize its profit from forwarding traffic. We show that the socially optimal routing can always be induced by an equilibrium where no node can increase its profit by unilaterally changing its bids. Inefficient equilibria arise in oligopolies due to the monopolistic pricing power of a superior relay. It results in finite price of anarchy if marginal cost functions are concave, but unbounded price of anarchy when they are convex. Pricing games of general topology suffer from the intrinsic multi-hop network structure, which gives rise to infinite price of anarchy.},

abstract={We investigate the impact of incomplete information on the problem of pricing and incentives in a two-hop parallel relay network with one source and multiple relays. We consider a pricing game with incomplete information where the relays advertise traffic dependent charging functions to the source, which then allocates its traffic in a multipath manner and pays the relays according to the advertised charging functions. In our setting, the state of the links for a given relay is not observable by the source or the other relays, although the prior distribution of the types is observable. To provide a benchmark, we first show that in the pricing game with complete information, Nash equilibria exist and are all efficient. In particular, there exist efficient equilibria resulting from linear charging functions. On the other hand, we show that in the game with incomplete information, linear charging functions may lead to inefficiencies. In particular, we quantify the efficiency loss in the symmetric case, where the type distributions and cost structure are identical for all relays.},

abstract={Recent research in the emerging field of cognitive radio (CR) has mainly focused on spectrum sensing and sharing, that allow an opportunistic use of the vacant portions of the licensed frequency bands by the CR users. Efficiently leveraging this node channel information in order to provide timely end-to-end delivery over the network is a key concern for CR based routing protocols. In addition, the primary users (PUs) of the licensed band affect the channels to varying extents, depending on the proportion of the transmission power that gets leaked into the adjacent channels. This also effects the geographical region, in which, the channel is rendered unusable for the CR users. In this paper, a geographic forwarding based SpEctrum aware routing protocol for Cognitive ad-Hoc networks (SEARCH), is proposed that jointly undertakes path and channel selection to avoid regions of PU activity during route formation. Specifically, the optimal paths found by geographic forwarding on each channel are combined at the destination with an aim to minimize the hop count. By binding the route to regions found free of PU activity, rather than particular CR users, the effect of the PU activity is mitigated. Our proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated through simulation study.},

ABSTRACT = {Cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs) are a class of cognitive radio networks. In recent years, they have gained popularity, and routing protocols have been proposed. Above all, the protocols based on on-demand routing are considered favorable in the literature. It is mainly because the accomplishments of ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing and dynamic source routing (DSR) in mobile ad hoc networks have lead to a number of adaptations of both protocols to suit CRAHNs. In this paper, we review the on-demand routing protocols applicable for CRAHNs, which are based on AODV, DSR, and hybrid protocols. After explaining their basic principles, we qualitatively compare the protocols in terms of inherent characteristics and performance. This paper further addresses the pros and cons of routing protocols and discusses research challenges and open issues.},

abstract={Cognitive radio offers a promising technology to mitigate spectrum shortage in wireless communications. It enables secondary users (SUs) to opportunistically access low-occupancy primary spectral bands as long as their negative effect on the primary user (PU) access is constrained. This PU protection requirement is particularly challenging for multiple SUs over a wide geographical area. In this paper, we study the fundamental performance limit on the throughput of cognitive radio networks under the PU packet collision constraint. With perfect sensing, we develop an optimum spectrum access strategy under generic PU traffic patterns. Without perfect sensing, we quantify the impact of missed detection and false alarm, and propose a modified threshold-based spectrum access strategy that achieves close-to-optimal performance. Moreover, we develop and evaluate a distributed access scheme that enables multiple SUs to collectively protect the PU while adapting to behavioral changes in PU usage patterns. Our results provide useful insight on the trade-off between the protection of the primary user and the throughput performance of cognitive radios.},

Assume the T_ON is exponentially distributed;

spectrum sensing is needed for each channel, then design utility for each channel, which considers the probality that the packet can be successfully transmitted (prediction based scheme); sender chooses the channel which has the highest probability that the channel will be free for data transmission.

relay resides on the channel which has the best historical records, answer RREP when hearing RREQ.

    abstract = {{This dissertation addresses the intersection of personal wireless technology and computational intelligence. The primary research issue addressed is the organization of radio domain knowledge into data structures processable in real-time that integrate machine learning and natural language processing technology into software radio. The thesis defines and develops the cognitive radio architecture. The features needed in the architecture are derived from cognitive radio use cases. These include inferring user communications context, shaping access- network demand, and realizing a protocol for real-time radio spectrum rental. Mathematical foundations for the knowledge-representation architecture are derived by applying point-set topology to the requirements of the use cases. This results in the set-theoretic ontology of radio knowledge defined in the Radio Knowledge Representation Language (RKRL). The mathematical analysis also demonstrates that isochronous radio software is not Turing- computable. Instead, it is constrained to a bounded-recursive subset of the total functions. A rapid-prototype cognitive radio, CR1, was developed to apply these mathematical foundations in a simulated environment. CR1 demonstrated the principles of cognitive radio and focused the research issues. This led to an important contribution of this dissertation, the cognitive radio architecture. This is an open architecture framework for integrating agent-based control, natural language processing, and machine learning technology into software-defined radio platforms.}},

propose distributed algorithm for power control problem in CDMA network.
PC has been discussed in literatures, some of which are from the perspective of games.
Available PC algorithm is NE in one-shot game. 
The authors propose two repeated games (RG), inifite repeated game and discounted repeated game to improve PC from NE to PE(pareto E).
what is the contribution of this paper:
Propose algorithm to achieve PE, propose RG to achieve better accumlated utilites.

abstract={In this paper, we consider a cellular cognitive radio network that uses opportunistic spectrum access for its transmission in the downlink direction from base stations toward cognitive radio users. Since the spectrum is licensed to a primary network, proper resource management should be employed in the secondary network to protect primary users against excessive interference while providing acceptable utilization for secondary users. We use game theory to propose a distributed method for joint frequency and power allocation in the downlink of cognitive radio networks. Earlier works in this area were based on centralized optimization-based approaches, whereas our proposed method solves the problem of joint resource allocation in a distributed way at lower complexity and less message passing. Comparing the proposed decentralized method with a centralized method shows that our proposed joint resource allocation scheme results in significantly less power consumption while supporting more secondary users.},

abstract={Although avoiding harmful interference to licensed incumbents is the prime concern of the system design for the emerging IEEE 802.22 standard, another key design challenge to cognitive radio based 802.22 systems is how to dynamically share the scarce spectrum among the collocated 802.22 network cells so that performance degradation, due to mutual co-channel interference, is effectively mitigated. This paper describes a distributed, cooperative, and real-time spectrum sharing protocol called On-Demand Spectrum Contention (ODSC) that employs interactive MAC messaging on an inter-network communication channel to provide efficient, scalable, and fair inter-network spectrum sharing among the coexisting 802.22 cells. Additionally, in order to support ODSC and other inter-network coordination functions in 802.22, we introduce a beacon-based inter-network communication protocol called the Beacon Period Framing (BPF) protocol that realizes a reliable, efficient, and scalable over-the- air inter-network communication channel utilizing the occupied RF channels of the network cells.},

abstract={This paper presents new design formulations that aim at optimizing the performance of an orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) ad hoc cognitive radio network through joint subcarrier assignment and power allocation. Aside from an important constraint on the tolerable interference induced to primary networks, to efficiently implement spectrum-sharing control within the unlicensed network, the optimization problems considered here strictly enforce upper and lower bounds on the total amount of temporarily available bandwidth that is granted to individual secondary users. These new requirements are of particular relevance in cognitive radio settings, where the spectral activities of primary users are highly dynamic, leaving little opportunity for secondary access. A dual decomposition framework is then developed for two criteria (throughput maximization and power minimization), which gives rise to the realization of distributed solutions. Because the proposed distributed protocols require very limited cooperation among the participating network elements, they are particularly applicable to ad hoc cognitive networks, where centralized processing and control are certainly inaccessible. In this paper, we recommend that the network collaboration is made possible through the implementation of virtual timers at individual secondary users and through the exchange of pertinent information over a common reserved channel. It is shown that not only is the computational complexity of the devised algorithms affordable but that the performance of these algorithms in practical scenarios attains the actual global optimum as well. The potential of the proposed approaches is thoroughly verified by asymptotic complexity analysis and numerical results.},

abstract={Resource allocation is one of the key issues to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization in cognitive radio networks. It has been widely investigated with the assumption that the secondary users have a good knowledge of the channel state information of primary system. However, it is not reasonable in practice owing to the imperfect sensing. In this paper, a high-efficiency resource allocation scheme is proposed by considering the imperfect spectrum sensing. Particularly, in order to solve the problem of interference and lower efficiency of spectrum utilization, interference constraints and quality of service requirement are considered to reduce the impact from imperfect spectrum sensing. The goal of the presented scheme is to maximizing the capacity under the interference constraints of primary users. Simulation results indicate that the proposed resource allocation scheme can represent the better performance successfully.},

abstract={Cognitive radio (CR) networks have an ample but dynamic amount of spectrum for communications. Communication rendezvous in CR networks is the process of establishing a control channel between radios before they can communicate. Designing a communication rendezvous protocol that can take advantage of all the available spectrum at the same time is of great importance, because it alleviates load on control channels, and thus further reduces probability of collisions. In this paper, we present ETCH, efficient channel-hopping-based MAC-layer protocols for communication rendezvous in CR networks. Compared to the existing solutions, ETCH fully exploits spectrum diversity in communication rendezvous by allowing all the rendezvous channels to be utilized at the same time. We propose two protocols, SYNC-ETCH, which is a synchronous protocol assuming CR nodes can synchronize their channel hopping processes, and ASYNC-ETCH, which is an asynchronous protocol not relying on global clock synchronization. Our theoretical analysis and ns-2-based evaluation show that ETCH achieves better performances of time-to-rendezvous and throughput than the existing work.},

abstract = "Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are composed of cognitive, spectrum-agile devices capable of changing their configurations on the fly based on the spectral environment. This capability opens up the possibility of designing flexible and dynamic spectrum access strategies with the purpose of opportunistically reusing portions of the spectrum temporarily vacated by licensed primary users. On the other hand, the flexibility in the spectrum access phase comes with an increased complexity in the design of communication protocols at different layers. This work focuses on the problem of designing effective routing solutions for multi-hop CRNs, which is a focal issue to fully unleash the potentials of the cognitive networking paradigm. We provide an extensive overview of the research in the field of routing for CRNs, clearly differentiating two main categories: approaches based on a full spectrum knowledge, and approaches that consider only local spectrum knowledge obtained via distributed procedures and protocols. In each category we describe and comment on proposed design methodologies, routing metrics and practical implementation issues. Finally, possible future research directions are also proposed. "

pages={ 2557 - 2562 Vol.4}, 
abstract={ While several cluster based routing algorithms have been proposed for ad hoc networks, there is a lack of formal mathematical analysis of these algorithms. Specifically, there is no published investigation of the relation between routing overhead on one hand and route request pattern (traffic) on the other. This paper provides a mathematical framework for quantifying the overhead of a cluster-based routing protocol. We explicitly model the application-level traffic in terms of the statistical description of the number of hops between a source and a destination. The network topology is modelled by a regular two-dimensional grid of unreliable nodes, and expressions for various components of the routing overhead are derived. The results show that clustering does not change the traffic requirement for infinite scalability compared to flat protocols, but reduces the overhead by a factor of O(1/M) where M is the cluster size. The analytic results are validated against simulations of random network topologies running a well known (D-hop max-min) clustering algorithm.},

abstract={ Numerous clustering algorithms have been proposed that can support routing in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). However, there is very little formal analysis that considers the communication overhead incurred by these procedures. Further, there is no published investigation of the overhead associated with the recursive application of clustering algorithms to support hierarchical routing. This paper provides a theoretical upper bound on the communication overhead incurred by a particular clustering algorithm for hierarchical routing in MANET. It is demonstrated that, given reasonable assumptions, the average clustering overhead generated per node per second is only polylogarithmic in the node count. To derive this result, novel techniques to assess cluster maintenance overhead are employed.},
