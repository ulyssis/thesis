 : abstract={This paper considers a Markovian dynamical game theoretic setting for distributed transmission control in a wireless sensor network. The available spectrum bandwidth is modeled as a Markov chain. A distributed algorithm named correlated Q-learning algorithm is proposed to obtain the correlated equilibrium policies of the system. This algorithm has the decentralized feature and is easily implementable in a real system. Numerical example is also provided to verify the performances of the proposed algorithms.},

 : abstract={Network formation games capture two conflicting objectives of self-interested nodes in a network. On one hand, such a node wishes to be able to reach all other nodes in the network; on the other hand, it wishes to minimize its cost of participation. We focus on myopic dynamics in a class of such games inspired by transportation and communication models. A key property of the dynamics we study is that they are local: nodes can only deviate to form links with others in a restricted neighborhood. Despite this locality, we find that our dynamics converge to efficient or nearly efficient outcomes in a range of settings of interest.},

 : abstract={Recent advances in cognitive radio (CR) technology have brought about a number of wireless standards that support opportunistic access to available white-space spectrum. Addressing the self-coexistence of CR networks in such an environment is very challenging, especially when coexisting networks operate in the same swath of spectrum with little or no direct coordination. In this paper, we study the problem of co-channel self-coexistence of uncoordinated CR networks that employ orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in the uplink. We frame the self-coexistence problem as a non-cooperative game, and propose an uplink soft frequency reuse (USFR) technique to enable globally power-efficient and locally fair sharing of white-space spectrum. In each network

We provide a unique optimal solution to the TPC subproblem, and present a low-complexity heuristic for the SCA subproblem. Furthermore, we frame the TPC and SCA games, and integrate them as a heuristic algorithm that achieves the Nash equilibrium in a fully distributed manner. Our simulation results show that the proposed USFR technique significantly improves self-coexistence in several aspects, including spectrum utilization, power consumption, and intra-cell fairness.},

 : abstract={Recent advances in cognitive radio (CR) technology have brought about a number of wireless standards that support opportunistic access to available white-space spectrum. Addressing the self-coexistence of CR networks in such an environment is very challenging, especially when coexisting networks operate in the same swath of spectrum with little or no direct coordination. In this paper, we study the problem of co-channel self-coexistence of uncoordinated CR networks that employ orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in the uplink. We frame the self-coexistence problem as a non-cooperative game, and propose an uplink soft frequency reuse (USFR) technique to enable globally power-efficient and locally fair sharing of white-space spectrum.

 : abstract={Recent advances in cognitive radio (CR) technology have brought about a number of wireless standards that support opportunistic access to available white-space spectrum. Addressing the self-coexistence of CR networks in such an environment is very challenging, especially when coexisting networks operate in the same swath of spectrum with little or no direct coordination. In this paper, we study the problem of co-channel self-coexistence of uncoordinated CR networks that employ orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in the uplink. We frame the self-coexistence problem as a non-cooperative game, and propose an uplink soft frequency reuse (USFR) technique to enable globally power-efficient and locally fair sharing of white-space spectrum. In each network, uplink resource allocation is decoupled into two subproblems: subchannel allocation (SCA) and transmit p

The available spectrum bandwidth is modeled as a Markov chain. A distributed algorithm named correlated Q-learning algorithm is proposed to obtain the correlated equilibrium policies of the system. This algorithm has the decentralized feature and is easily implementable in a real system. Numerical example is also provided to verify the performances of the proposed algorithms.},

 : abstract={The Cognitive Radio (CR) technology enables the unlicensed users to share the spectrum with the licensed users on a non-interfering basis. Spectrum sensing is an important function for the unlicensed users to determine availability of a channel in the licensed user's spectrum. However, spectrum sensing consumes considerable energy which can be reduced by employing predictive methods for discovering spectrum holes. Using a reliable prediction scheme, the unlicensed users will sense only those channels which are predicted to be idle. By achieving a low probability of error in predicting the idle channels, the spectrum utilization can also be improved. Since the traffic characteristics of most licensed user systems encountered in real life are not known a priori, we design the spectrum predictor using the neural network
